# Outreach Email Templates

Three variants for A/B testing validation outreach to SaaS founders and support leads.

## Template A: Problem-Focused (Recommended for Cold Outreach)

**Subject:** Quick question about your support costs

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] is in the [industry/vertical] space. I'm building a tool to help SaaS companies reduce customer support costs by 60-80% using AI.

Before I build, I'd love to understand your current situation:

1. Roughly how much do you spend on customer support per month? (team salaries, tools, etc.)
2. What's your biggest support pain point right now? (queue length, response time, cost, team burnout?)
3. Would you be open to a 20-minute call this week to discuss?

I'm not selling anything—just validating whether this problem is worth solving.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

P.S. If you're too busy, a quick 2-sentence reply works too.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short.

Either way, I appreciate your time.
