# Validation Call Interview Script

15-20 minute script for discovery calls with potential customers.

## Pre-Call Prep

1. Research the company:
   - Company size, revenue (if public)
   - Recent news/funding
   - Their support channels (check website)
   - Any public complaints about support

2. Set expectations:
   - "This is a discovery call, not a sales pitch"
   - "I'm building something and want your feedback"
   - "15-20 minutes max"

## Opening (2 minutes)

**You:** "Thanks for making time! Quick context: I'm building an AI customer service chatbot for SaaS companies. Before I build the wrong thing, I want to understand how companies like yours actually handle support. This is purely research—no pitch, I promise."

**Them:** [Usually: "Sure, happy to help"]

**You:** "Great. I'll ask about 8-10 questions, should take 15 minutes. Sound good?"

---

## Core Questions (12-15 minutes)

### 1. Current State

**Q:** "First, can you walk me through how customer support works at [Company Name] today?"

**Listen for:**
- Team size
- Channels (email, chat, phone)
- Volume (inquiries per month)
- Tools they use (Zendesk, Intercom, etc.)

**Follow-up if needed:**
- "How many people are on the support team?"
- "What's your average response time?"
- "What tools do you use?"

---

### 2. Pain Points (Most Important)

**Q:** "What's the biggest challenge with support right now?"

**Listen for:**
- Cost (salaries, tools)
- Volume (too many tickets)
- Quality (team burnout, mistakes)
- Speed (slow response times)
- Coverage (24/7 expectations)

**Follow-up:**
- "How much does support cost you per month? (rough estimate)"
- "What happens when you get a spike in tickets?"
- "Do you have 24/7 coverage, or business hours only?"

**Score this:** 1-10 pain intensity (write down)

---

### 3. Current Solutions

**Q:** "What have you tried to solve this? (hiring, tools, automation, etc.)"

**Listen for:**
- What worked / didn't work
- Why they stopped using something
- What they wish existed

**Follow-up:**
- "Have you tried any AI chatbots before?"
- "What didn't work about [previous solution]?"

---

### 4. Willingness to Pay (Critical)

**Q:** "Hypothetically, if there was a tool that could handle 70% of your support inquiries automatically, reducing your costs by 60-80%, what would that be worth to you per month?"

**If they hesitate:**
- "I know it's hypothetical, but ballpark?"
- "What would you pay for something that saves you $X/month?" (use their cost number)

**Listen for:**
- Specific dollar amount
- "It depends on..." (what does it depend on?)
- "I'd need to see it first" (good sign—means they're interested)

**Score this:** Would pay $500+/mo? (Yes/No/Maybe)

---

### 5. Must-Have Features

**Q:** "If you were evaluating an AI support tool, what would be the top 3 things it MUST do?"

**Listen for:**
- Specific features (integrations, analytics, customization)
- Outcomes (reduce tickets, improve satisfaction)
- Concerns (security, accuracy, setup time)

**Write these down verbatim**—these are your MVP features.

---

### 6. Decision Process

**Q:** "If you were to buy something like this, who would be involved in the decision? (CFO, support manager, CTO, etc.)"

**Listen for:**
- Who has budget authority
- Who would use it
- Who would evaluate it
- Timeline (how long to decide)

---

### 7. Current Alternatives

**Q:** "Are you actively looking for solutions to this problem, or is it more of a 'nice to have'?"

**Listen for:**
- "We're actively looking" → HOT LEAD
- "It's on our roadmap" → WARM
- "Not a priority right now" → COLD (but still valuable feedback)

---

### 8. Objections / Concerns

**Q:** "What would make you NOT want to use an AI chatbot for support?"

**Listen for:**
- Accuracy concerns
- Customer experience worries
- Setup complexity
- Cost concerns
- Security/compliance

**These are your risks to address in MVP.**

---

## Closing (2-3 minutes)

**You:** "This has been super helpful. Last question: If I build this and it actually works—handles 70% of inquiries, saves you 60% on costs—would you be interested in being an early beta customer? (Free for 3 months, then paid)"

**If Yes:**
- "Great! I'll follow up in [timeline] when I have something to show. Can I add you to my beta list?"

**If Maybe:**
- "What would need to happen for you to say yes?"
- "Can I check back in [timeframe]?"

**If No:**
- "Totally understand. What would need to change?"

**You:** "One more thing—do you know any other SaaS founders or support managers who might be interested in this? (No pressure, just if someone comes to mind)"

**Thank them and end on time.**

## Post-Call Actions

1. **Immediately after call:**
   - Fill out validation spreadsheet
   - Score: Pain intensity (1-10), Willingness to pay (Y/N/M), Hot/Warm/Cold
   - Write down 3-5 key quotes

2. **Within 24 hours:**
   - Send thank you email
   - Share 1-2 insights you learned (shows you listened)
   - If they said yes to beta: "I'll keep you updated on progress"

3. **Pattern recognition:**
   - After 5 calls: What pain points come up most?
   - After 10 calls: What features are must-haves?
   - After 15 calls: Is there a clear "yes" pattern?

---

## Red Flags (Stop Building If...)

- Less than 5/20 say they'd pay $500+/mo
- Pain intensity average < 7/10
- Everyone says "nice to have, not urgent"
- No one can name a budget owner

## Green Lights (Proceed to MVP If...)

- 10+/20 say they'd pay $500+/mo
- Pain intensity average > 7/10
- Multiple people say "we're actively looking"
- Clear pattern in must-have features

---

## Example Call Flow

**You:** "Thanks for the time! I'm building an AI support chatbot. Before I build wrong, want to understand your situation."

**Them:** "Sure, happy to help."

**You:** "Great. First, how does support work at [Company] today?"

**Them:** "We have a team of 5, handle about 2000 tickets/month. Use Zendesk. Costs us roughly $80K/year in salaries."

**You:** "Got it. What's your biggest challenge?"

**Them:** "Volume is killing us. We can't hire fast enough, and customers expect 24/7. We're burning out the team."

**You:** "On a scale of 1-10, how painful is this?"

**Them:** "8 or 9. It's our #1 operational cost."

**You:** "If there was a tool that handled 70% automatically, what would you pay?"

**Them:** "If it actually worked? $1000/month, easy. Saves us way more than that."

**You:** "What would it need to do?"

**Them:** "Integrate with Zendesk, handle common questions, escalate when needed. Setup can't take weeks."

**You:** "Would you be interested in beta testing when I have something?"

**Them:** "Yes, definitely."

**You:** "Perfect. I'll follow up in 6-8 weeks. Thanks so much!"
