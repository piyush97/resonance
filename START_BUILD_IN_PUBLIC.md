**Title**: "Building Resonance: AI Chatbot for B2B SaaS ($0 → $1M ARR)"

**Post**:
```
Hey IH community! 👋

Starting a new journey today. Building Resonance - an AI customer service chatbot for B2B SaaS companies.

**The Problem**:
B2B SaaS companies spend $100K-500K/year on customer support. Most inquiries are repetitive and could be automated.

**The Solution**:
AI chatbot that:
- Handles 70% of inquiries automatically
- Learns from your help docs
- Integrates with existing tools
- Saves 60%+ on support costs

**My Approach**:
1. Build complete product first (7 days)
2. Validate with 10-15 customer calls (Week 2)
3. Onboard beta customers (Week 3)
4. Iterate to $1M ARR (12 months)

**Tech Stack** (100% free for now):
- Pinecone for vector search (integrated embeddings)
- Ollama for local LLM (my RTX 5070 Ti)
- Next.js + FastAPI
- Cost: $0/month

**Day 0 Progress**:
✅ KB service with RAG pipeline
✅ API service with WebSocket
✅ Landing page
✅ Chat widget component
✅ All services running locally

**Next 7 Days**:
- Day 1: Dashboard UI
- Day 2: Widget integration
- Day 3: E2E testing
- Day 4: Database & auth
- Day 5: Polish
- Day 6: Deploy
- Day 7: Demo materials

I'll be sharing daily updates here and on Twitter (@your_handle).

Questions:
1. Would this be useful for your SaaS?
2. What's your current support cost?
3. What features would you need?

Let's build! 🚀
