# Resonance Project Rules

## Project Context
- Building AI customer service chatbot SaaS for B2B SaaS companies
- Current phase: VALIDATION (Week 1-2)
- Goal: 20 validation calls, confirm $500/mo willingness to pay
- Budget: Tight bootstrap (<$2K/month)

## Architecture
- Monorepo: Next.js (web), Node.js/Fastify (API), Python/FastAPI (KB service)
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Vector DB: Pinecone
- LLM: OpenAI (GPT-3.5 for 90%, GPT-4 for complex)

## Constraints
- No features outside MVP scope (widget, KB upload, basic analytics, escalation)
- Use free tiers until 10 paying customers
- Every feature must trace to customer pain point
- Weekly revenue focus: "How does this get us closer to first $500?"

## Phase Management
- Validation: Customer calls, problem validation
- MVP: Narrow feature set, shipping demoable product
- Beta: 3-5 design partners, feedback loops
- Growth: 10-50 paying customers, retention focus

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode
- Python type hints
- Clear error handling
- Document complex logic

## File Organization
- `/apps/web` - Next.js dashboard
- `/apps/api` - Node.js conversation service
- `/services/kb` - Python RAG pipeline
- `/packages/widget` - Embeddable React widget
- `/docs` - Documentation, templates, guides
