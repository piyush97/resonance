## ONE MORE THING: The Hardest Part

The hardest part isn't building the product.

The hardest part is **talking to customers.**

Most tech founders hate sales. You'll hate it too. But:

- **Good news:** Sales is a skill you can learn
- **Good news:** You have 18 months to learn it
- **Reality:** Founders who talk to 10+ customers/month win
- **Reality:** Founders who hide in code fail

**Your single biggest job:** Listen to customers, not your instincts.

If customers say "we want X" but you think "Y is better" → Build X.

Your job is not to be right. Your job is to make customers happy.

## FINAL DECISION: Are You In?

**This requires:**
- ✅ 60-80 hours/week for 18 months
- ✅ Willingness to hear "no" 1,000 times
- ✅ Ability to learn sales (your weakest area probably)
- ✅ 6-9 month personal runway ($30-50K or freelance)
- ✅ Belief that this can work (even when it's hard)

**If YES → Start this week with Week 1 checklist**

**If NO → That's okay, different path for you**

**If MAYBE → Do Week 1 validation first, make decision then**
